It can be tricky to remember the details of Scanners in the above, for example, but once we've done it once and package that into our method we can forget. All we need to remember is the method that does it is inputString so we can call it. This is called abstraction which just means hiding details. Here we are hiding the details of how to input a String behind the method name inputString. We are doing one kind of abstraction called procedural abstraction (or functional abstraction). It just means packaging instructions into procedures (or functions) so that we do not then need to worry in future how they work, just what they do overall. Here inputString (somehow) gets a string from the user and returns it. When we write the instruction to call it, we don't care, and don't have to know, how it does it.\n",

        "\n",
        "- This allows us to test each part completely separately. Doing so reduces the chance that the code contains mistakes.\n",
        "\n",
        "- They allow us to avoid duplicating code. We can write one method that contains the code, and then call it whenever we need it. This ensures consistency, and removes the possibility of getting it right in one place but not elsewhere.\n",
        "\n",
        "- They allow us to write a general method that covers several similar jobs that otherwise would need different code.   We replace the parts that are different by variables and supply the different information needed when we call the method. This is called **generalisation**. Again this lessens the likelihood of there being bugs in our programs. We have fewer methods to test.\n",
        "\n",
        "- They allow us to ignore the implementation of the method. Once we have written it and are sure it works, we do not need to think about *how* or *why* it works. This is called **abstraction** This makes the later code easier to write, so it is more likely to be right.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The fact that the way a method is implemented is hidden, means we can change that implementation (ie the code in the definition of the method) for a better implementation. Change it in one place and it changes everywhere for free. This means we are less likely to introduce mistakes when making changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "- All of this also makes code easier to read as we can read and understand it a small part at a time."
