        "For reference types (Strings, arrays and records) the value stored in the variable on the stack (and the immediate result of evaluating an expression that gives such a value) is the reference to where the data is stored. Therefore == just checks the references and so whether they are pointing to the same storage space on the stack. It does not look at the actual values. Sometimes two variables holding the same values can point to the same copy of the value, but at other times they may not. == cannot therefore be relied on to compare string values unless you want to know where they are stored. \n",
        "\n",
        "Instead, for Strings, .equals must be used, though .equals also does not work as expected for arrays or records. You can define your own equality operators that do follow the references and so compare the actual values. Do this for any record type that you need to compare values. In some situations you want to compare all the values of a record for equality. At other times you may just be trying to match particular fields such as a name field or an ID field. Which you need depends on the task at hand. "
