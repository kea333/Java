        "### Why another loop\n",
        "We have already seen a way to do repetition, with the counter-controlled loop. Why do we need another kind of loop? Because there are some kinds of repetition that cannot be done with a counter-controlled loop. In particular, counter-controlled loops rely on knowing how many times the loop will execute in advance - knowing what the counter is to count to. If the loop needs to **repeat an unknown number of times** (in the sense that it can't be worked out when the loop starts), then we need something else.\n",
        "\n",
        "That is what a _while_ loop is for. It is a completely general kind of loop that can do any kind of repetition possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q1: Write a program that prints some phrase repeatedly. After each time, it asks if you want it to do it again. If you type anything other than yes (Y), then it will immediately stop the loop and print \"OK, I will stop then. Have a nice day\" before terminating.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you type \"Y\" when asked, then it will print its message again (and ask again), continuing to do so an unlimited number of times until you type something other than \"Y\" when asked."
