The first thing this does is call sumton_recursive(2) i.e. it does a recursive call with argument 2. What that call is doing is working out the sum to 2 (i.e. working out 2+1+0). Once it has that answer to that calculation (3) which it stores in variable _answerssofar_, it adds the current countdown value to it (also 3) to give the total 6. \n",

At that point they are restored as the visible values of variables with those names.\n",

It was, so the value 0 was just returned with no more fuss (i.e. no recursive call needed this time). That allowed sumton_recursive(1) to calculate and return its total (1), which allowed sumton_recursive(2) to calculate and return its total (3), which allowed sumton_recursive(3) to calculate and return its total (6).\n",
